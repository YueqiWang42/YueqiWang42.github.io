I am currenty a third-year Ph.D. student  in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.pitt.edu/) at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/), advised by [Dr. Xulong Tang](https://xzt102.github.io/). I received my B.E. degree from Sun Yat-sen University in 2022.

My research interests lie primarily in the area of **computer architecture**, with a focus on virtual memory for multi-GPU.
